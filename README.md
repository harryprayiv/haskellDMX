<b>Pockonsolve - Version 0.1.0</b>

<i>Experimental DMX Microcontroller</i>

LIBRARIES USED:
  - TeensyDmx Library
  - U8G2 Library
  - Keypad Library
  - EasingLibrary



FEATURES:
  - 8 or 16-bit DMX Support
  - 12 Key keypad parsing (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, And, Minus, S, @, Enter, Thru)
  - momentary, latch or instantaneous buttons
  - Stable analog to DMX conversion for potentiometers and other sensors

   IN THE WORKS:
  - interpolation algorithms using the easing library
  - Pockonsole Mini (faders are replaced by knobs)
  - DMX timing variables and state machine


0.1.1 - Optimizing and separating keypad keypadLogic into a an Arduino library

0.1.0 - Slowly implementing Easing first with display then with DMX (very early stages)

0.0.9 - Added clearbuffer and sendbuffer statements into previous U8G2 print functions

0.0.8 - Added a switch for Serial debug or OLED

0.0.7 - keypad control flow cleanup (still needs work)

0.0.6 - keypad control flow begun

0.0.5 - keypad command buidling

0.0.4 - initial work on keypad parsing

0.0.3 - initial repository start

0.0.2 - sending DMX values and reading faders with master scaler

0.0.1 - display values on OLED using U8G2 and reading faders with master scaler

0.0.0 - initial repository start
